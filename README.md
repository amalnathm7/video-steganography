# Advancing Video Steganography: Achieving High-Capacity Multimedia Data Hiding with Enhanced Quality and Security

## Abstract

Video steganography is a technique that involves hiding secret messages within a video while minimising any noticeable changes or distortions. The proposed work aims to embed multimedia data inside a video in a secure and inconspicuous manner using different phases such as input preprocessing, frame selection, region selection, and data embedding. To enhance the security of input data, AES encryption technique is used as a preprocessing step. To embed the encrypted data into the cover video with minimal distortion, key frames are selected using the Histogram Difference Frame Selection (HDFS) method. The number of key frames to be selected is determined based on the size of the input data. Robust regions are identified among the chosen key frames by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique as they offer better resistance to distortions caused by embedding data. Afterwards, the encrypted data, encryption key, data size, and initialization vector are embedded into the robust regions using the adaptive LSB332 technique which involves the modification of least significant bits of the pixel values. To ensure the receiver can accurately extract embedded information from the video, the indices of the key frames and robust regions are further embedded in random frames generated using a seed function. Experiments were conducted on different cover videos and input datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using different quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, NCC, BER, etc. The results show that the proposed work outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in video steganography. 

## Proposed Methodology

The main purpose of the proposed methodology is to allow the embedding of multimedia data in a cover video. The proposed system preprocesses the secret input data before embedding it inside robust regions selected within optimal frames of the cover video. The resulting stego video is then transmitted to the receiver, who extracts the hidden data using inverse operations. This systematic approach ensures secure data hiding and extraction within the cover video for reliable transmission through any communication channel. The following figure represents the general flow diagram of the proposed methodology which consists of five different phases: Input Preprocessing, Frame Selection, Region Selection, Data Embedding and Data Extraction.

In the first phase, the multimedia input data, whether text, image, audio, or video, undergoes encryption using the AES symmetric encryption method to ensure the confidentiality of the input data. Simultaneously, the size of the encrypted data is calculated and stored for subsequent phases. This information becomes crucial for determining the number of key frames to be selected and for embedding the data into the cover video. The second phase involves calculating the total number of frames in the cover video. Key frames are then selected using a histogram difference calculation between consecutive frames. Frames with the largest histogram difference are chosen as key frames. The number of key frames selected corresponds to the size of the input data. In the third phase, robust regions within the selected key frames are identified. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is employed to determine these regions, which are less prone to visual changes caused by the embedding process. This ensures a higher level of visual quality in the resulting stego video. The fourth phase is dedicated to the actual embedding process. The encrypted input data, along with the encryption key, data size, and initialization vector, is embedded into the robust regions using the adaptive LSB332 technique. This technique modifies the least significant bits of the RGB values of pixels within the selected regions. By doing so, the data is hidden within the video while minimising noticeable visual artefacts. Additionally, the indices of the key frames and robust regions are embedded within random frames selected using a seed function. This step enhances the security of the embedded data and facilitates its accurate extraction at the receiver's end. The following figure illustrates the detailed flowchart of the proposed methodology.
